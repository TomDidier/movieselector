# Movie selector

A project to get the ten best movies in one genre, from chosen period of time, out of a database of 5000 movies from The Movie Database API, thanks to a web interface.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Two databases need to be install from Kaggle:
Metadata on ~5,000 movies from TMDB: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
Metadata on over 45,000 movies. 26 million ratings from over 270,000 users : 
https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

Softwares and libraries used:
Python:
Pandas
Ast
Tabulate
Matplotlib
Numpy
Scipy
Sklearn

It is advised to run top10.py on Jupyter Notebook.

### Installing

Download the databases from sources
Download top10.py

## Running the tests



### Break down into end to end tests

Matplotlib_scatter_plot.py : by running this file, you can have an overview of how the budget invested in movies is correlated to the average vote viewers will give. It is a visual representation of the database

```
The scatter plot shows that the correlation looks like a Gauss curve with an average vote at 6/10
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
